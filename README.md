## Anonymous vs authenticated session

**âš  WARNING: due to lack of time, anonymous session strategy is no longer maintained. If someone wants to keep
support for this feature and become a project maintainer, please be free to pm me.**  

By default the scraper will run in anonymous mode (no authentication required). In some environments (e.g. AWS or Heroku) 
this may be not possible though. You may face the following error message:

```
Scraper failed to run in anonymous mode, authentication may be necessary for this environment.
```

In that case the only option available is to run using an authenticated session. These are the steps required:
1. Login to LinkedIn using an account of your choice.
2. Open Chrome developer tools:

![](https://github.com/spinlud/py-linkedin-jobs-scraper/raw/master/images/img3.png)

3. Go to tab `Application`, then from left panel select `Storage` -> `Cookies` -> `https://www.linkedin.com`. In the
main view locate row with name `li_at` and copy content from the column `Value`.

![](https://github.com/spinlud/py-linkedin-jobs-scraper/raw/master/images/img4.png)

4. Set the environment variable `LI_AT_COOKIE` with the value obtained in step 3, then run your application as normal.
Example:

```shell script
LI_AT_COOKIE=<your li_at cookie value here> python your_app.py
```

## Rate limiting
You may experience failing requests with the status code 429. This means you are sending too many request to the server
and they are being throttled. You can overcome this by:

- Trying a higher value for `slow_mo` parameter (this will slow down scraper execution). 
- Reducing the value of `max_workers` to limit concurrency. I recommend to use no more than one worker in authenticated
  mode.

The right value for `slow_mo` parameter largely depends on rate-limiting settings on Linkedin servers (and this can 
vary over time). For the time being, I suggest a value of at least `1.3` in anonymous mode and `0.5` in authenticated
mode.

## Filters
It is possible to customize queries with the following filters:
- RELEVANCE:
    * `RELEVANT`
    * `RECENT`
- TIME:
    * `DAY`
    * `WEEK`
    * `MONTH`
    * `ANY`
- TYPE:
    * `FULL_TIME`
    * `PART_TIME`
    * `TEMPORARY`
    * `CONTRACT`
- EXPERIENCE LEVEL:
    * `INTERNSHIP`
    * `ENTRY_LEVEL`
    * `ASSOCIATE`
    * `MID_SENIOR`
    * `DIRECTOR`
- ON SITE OR REMOTE:
    * `ON_SITE`
    * `REMOTE`
    * `HYBRID`
    
See the following example for more details:

```python
from linkedin_jobs_scraper.query import Query, QueryOptions, QueryFilters
from linkedin_jobs_scraper.filters import RelevanceFilters, TimeFilters, TypeFilters, ExperienceLevelFilters, \
    OnSiteOrRemoteFilters

query = Query(
    query='Engineer',
    options=QueryOptions(
        locations=['United States'],        
        apply_link=True,
        skip_promoted_jobs=True,
        limit=5,
        filters=QueryFilters(
            relevance=RelevanceFilters.RECENT,
            time=TimeFilters.MONTH,
            type=[TypeFilters.FULL_TIME, TypeFilters.INTERNSHIP],
            experience=[ExperienceLevelFilters.INTERNSHIP, ExperienceLevelFilters.MID_SENIOR],
            on_site_or_remote=[OnSiteOrRemoteFilters.REMOTE],  # supported only with authenticated session
        )
    )
)
```

### Company Filter

It is also possible to filter by company using the public company jobs url on LinkedIn. To find this url you have to:
 1. Login to LinkedIn using an account of your choice.
 2. Go to the LinkedIn page of the company you are interested in (e.g. [https://www.linkedin.com/company/google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google)).
 3. Click on `jobs` from the left menu.
 
 ![](https://github.com/spinlud/py-linkedin-jobs-scraper/raw/master/images/img1.png)

 
 4. Scroll down and locate `See all jobs` or `See jobs` button.
 
 ![](https://github.com/spinlud/py-linkedin-jobs-scraper/raw/master/images/img2.png)
 
 5. Right click and copy link address (or navigate the link and copy it from the address bar).
 6. Paste the link address in code as follows:
 
```python
query = Query(    
    options=QueryOptions(        
        filters=QueryFilters(
            # Paste link below
            company_jobs_url='https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?f_C=1441%2C17876832%2C791962%2C2374003%2C18950635%2C16140%2C10440912&geoId=92000000',        
        )
    )
)
```
  
## Logging
Package logger can be retrieved using namespace `li:scraper`. Default level is `INFO`. 
It is possible to change logger level using environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` or in code:

```python
import logging

# Change root logger level (default is WARN)
logging.basicConfig(level = logging.DEBUG)

# Change package logger level
logging.getLogger('li:scraper').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Optional: change level to other loggers
logging.getLogger('urllib3').setLevel(logging.WARN)
logging.getLogger('selenium').setLevel(logging.WARN)
```
